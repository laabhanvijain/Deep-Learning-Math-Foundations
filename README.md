# Deep-Learning-Math-Foundations
Mathematical foundations and Deep Learning algorithms implemented from scratch.

## Overview
This repository documents my journey implementing Deep Learning algorithms from first principles. It focuses on the **mathematical derivation** behind the models (Probability, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Optimisation) and their **low-level implementation** in PyTorch and NumPy, everything from scratch.
The goal is not just to use libraries, but to understand the mechanics under the hood.

## Tech Stack
* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:** PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, Torchvision
